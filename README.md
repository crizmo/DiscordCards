## About The Project

<!-- [![Breeze][]]() -->

Breeze helps you display your discord activity on your website / anywhere you want using the api or the client.

Here's what breeze offers:
* client (website): display your discord activity on the website
* server (backend): display your discord activity as a api image which u can use on your website or anywhere you want

## Usage

Breeze is very easy to use.
You can either use the api endpoint to display your discord activity or get your discord activity using the breeze client website.

You can display your discord activity as a card or a compact card.
The endpoint are the following:
<a href="https://api-breeze.herokuapp.com/api/card/:id">User card large</a> <br>
<a href="https://api-breeze.herokuapp.com/api/compact/:id">User card compact</a> <br>
Replace :id with your discord id + you can add the optional queries too.
The queries are:

  * banner: url of the banner image
  * about: about the user
  * type: discord activity type

  * large_image: url of the large image
  * small_image: url of the small image
  * side_image: url of the side image

  large_image, small_image , side_image are basically the activity images.

One of the biggest issue that i still haven't figured out is with github caching api images.

Would love to get some help from those who know how to fix this issue.
